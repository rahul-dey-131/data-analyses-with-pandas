# data-analyses-with-pandas
A simple yet powerful project where I play around with fake sales data using Pandas! From grouping and sorting to plotting bar and pie charts â€” this project helped me understand how to make sense of messy data and turn it into clear, visual insights.  Great for beginners learning data analysis with Python.
