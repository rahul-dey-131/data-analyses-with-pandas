📊 Playing with Sales Data using Python & Pandas

Hey there! 👋
This is a fun little project where I created my own fake sales dataset from scratch and then explored it using Python. No real data? No problem — I used the Faker library to generate realistic names, cities (from all over Bangladesh!), and product purchases.


💡 What’s Inside?
- A dataset of 1000 fake sales records

- Random products, quantities, prices, payment methods, and cities

- Cleaned, sorted, and analyzed using pandas

- 📈 Bar charts for top-selling products

- 🥧 Pie charts showing city-wise sales performance

- Categorized orders by price: Low, Medium, High & Very High

  

📁 Files Included
- data_generator.ipynb → creates the dataset and saves it as sales_data.csv

- analysis.ipynb → loads the data, cleans it, and builds visual charts



🛠️ Tools I Used
- pandas and numpy for data work

- faker (with Bengali locale) to make names and cities feel like home

- matplotlib for the visual flair

- jupyter notebook to keep things organized



🎯 Why I Did This
I wanted to practice:

- Making datasets without relying on real ones

- Cleaning and analyzing data like a pro

- Making charts that actually look nice (yes, dark mode!)

- And most importantly — having fun while learning!



🚀 How to Run It Yourself
1. Clone this repo

2. Install the required packages:

    bash command: `pip install pandas numpy faker matplotlib`

3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code

4. Run the cells from top to bottom — and see the magic happen!



Thanks for stopping by! 🙌
Feel free to fork this project, play around with the data, or build your own version with new product ideas.

Let me know if you'd like help adding interactivity (like using Plotly), or exporting the charts as images!
